# 📊 Session 8: Advanced Boxplots and Scatterplots with Patterns and Themes

This session presents enhanced visualization techniques using `ggplot2`, `ggpattern`, `ggpubr`, `patchwork`, and `cowplot`.  
The focus is on customizing boxplots, bar plots, and scatterplots using patterns, group aesthetics, and theme variations.
