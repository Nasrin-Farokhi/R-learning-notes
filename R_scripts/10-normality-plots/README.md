# 📊 Session 10: Normality and Distribution Plots

This session focuses on testing normality and distributional assumptions using boxplots and Q-Q plots. We visualize the distribution of the `Production` dataset and examine the presence of outliers or non-normal patterns.

## 📦 1. Boxplot of Production  
A classic boxplot to visualize central tendency, spread, and potential outliers.
