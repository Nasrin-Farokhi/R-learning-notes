  ## 🧰 Dependencies
  
  Make sure to have the following R packages installed:
  - `tidyverse`
- `RColorBrewer`

## 📦 Usage

Each plot is saved as an image to illustrate a specific aesthetic or structural modification. The `.R` script associated with these plots can be found in the `07-advanced-visualization.R` file.
